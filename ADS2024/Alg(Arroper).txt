1. Start
2. Read Function ;
    input size of the array and declare the array
    loop index from zero to size and input data for each index in the array
2. display Function ;
    loop from zero index to size 
    display array[index]
3. Insert Function ;
    Input position and element to be inserted
    increment size
    loop index from size to position-1; shift array[index-1] to array[index]
    exit loop and assign element to array[position]
4. Delete Function ;
    Input position to Delete
    loop from position-1 to size,shift array[index+1] to array[index]
    exit loop and decrement size
5.  Search Function ;

    Initialize Outer Loop from index to size-1 to iterates over the entire array 
    Initialize Inner Loop from index(j) to size-2 to compares each element to the next one in sequence
    if the element at array[j] > array[j + 1] swap the elements
        Set temp = a[j]
        Set a[j] = a[j + 1]
        Set a[j + 1] = temp
    End inner loop
    End Outer Loop
6. Input Choice for the user asking which function to be executed
7. Switch and Call Each functions according to each case of the user
